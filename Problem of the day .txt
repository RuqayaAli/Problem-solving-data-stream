Problem of the day: 


Algorithm 

	•	Make a triangle using black and white colour of balls.
	•	give two integers white and black representing the count of white and black balls.
	•	Black >= 0 and white >= 0. 
	•	Make a triangle using balls.
	•	Starting from the top with odd number of white ball. 
	•	The next line should have black color balls only.
	•	The lines which have the black color balls should contain even number of ball.
	•	Determine the hight of triangle. 



Pseudcode: 

 white = 1 
 black = 10
 Hight =?
 while white >= 1 and black >=1
 if white %2 !== 0
 Hight += 1
 white = white - hight
 elif black %2 == 0
 Hight += 1
 black =black -Hight 
 ptint ("the hight of triangle is: ",Hight)
