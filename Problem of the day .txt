Problem of the day: 


Algorithm 

	•	Make a triangle using black and white colour of balls.
	•	give two integers white and black representing the count of white and black balls.
	•	Black >= 1 and white <= 100. 
	•	Make a triangle using balls.
	•	Starting from the top with odd number of white ball. 
	•	The next line should have black color balls only.
	•	The lines which have the black color balls should contain even number of ball.
	•	Determine the hight of triangle. 



Pseudcode:
